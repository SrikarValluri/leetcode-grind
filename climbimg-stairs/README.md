# climbing stairs

For the climbing stairs problem, we know at the ith step, we can only reach it from the i-1th step or the i-2nd step. Therefore the sum of the number of paths to get to i-1 and i-2 is the number of paths to get to i. At the 0th step, there's only 1 way of getting there, and same with the first (you can't go 2 stairs to get to either one of these).

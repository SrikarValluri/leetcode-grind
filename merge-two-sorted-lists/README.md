# merge two sorted lists

1) created head node so I didn't have to deal with special conditions in the beginning
2) two pointers, one on each node, and iterated after used
3) temp pointer that started from head node and added each node depending on comparison
4) did a "mergesort" type implementation where after one node was null, iterated through either one depending on which was not null

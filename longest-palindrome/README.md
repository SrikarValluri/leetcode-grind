# longest palindrome

For the longest palindrome problem, I made an algorithm such that: 1) any char with even number of integers in string can all be used for effectively free (two on either side of the string). 2) out of all chars that only appears once, only one of them can be used in the string (in the center) 3) any odd  number of chars can be used when you subtract 1 from the count (then it becomes like even case). That's the algorithm and it works!

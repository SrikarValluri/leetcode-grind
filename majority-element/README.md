# majority element

Super straightforward problem- just count everything up and return the max value.

The question also mentioned to do this in linear time + O(1) space. No clue how to do this, will come back to this problem later. I also couldn't actually find a solution with linear time + O(1) space, I found nlogn + O(1) space, but not O(n) + space O(1).


Anyway
